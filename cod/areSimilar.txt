Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

code
int i;
bool areSimilar(int[] a, int[] b) =>
    a.Count(x => x != b[i++]) < 3 & a.Sum(x => 1M/x - 1M/b[^i--]) == 0;
